### Data structure

1. Check the structure of the *soil* dataframe
2. What variable class does *Layer* belong to? 
4. How many levels does *Forest Type* have? What are they?

### Drop/Add columns

1. Create a new dataframe (DF1) considering only columns 2-5 in *soil*
2. Create an ID.Num vector with as many elements as rows in the new dataframe
3. Attach ID.Num to the new dataframe (DF1)

### Change column names

1. Change the following column names in the *soil* dataframe as indicated:
- Org_Matter to OM
- Mic_BiomassC to C_biomass
- Mic_BiomassN to N_biomass

### Subsetting

1. Create a new dataframe (degrade) by subsetting the *soil* dataframe to all *Forest_Type* = **Degraded** 
2. Check the structure of *degrade*. How many factors are in Forest_Type? What must be done to correct this? 
3. Create a new dataframe (acidic) by subsetting *soil* with all *pH* lower than 4.
4. How many observations does *acidic* have?
