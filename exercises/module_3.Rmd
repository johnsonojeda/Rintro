### Dataframe structures
1. Check the structure of the *soil* dataframe
2. What types of variables does it have? 
3. How many levels does *Forest_type* have? What does this mean? 

2. Use R to calculate:
- a * b
- b - (c/a)
- (c/a)^2 - (b*a) + a 

### Data types 

1. What data class does *Mic_BiomassC* belong to? 
2. Coerce *Mic_BiomassC* into an integer? Retrieve its new value
3. Coerce *pH* into a character, can this value be used for computation? 
3. Which variable would you choose to convert from factor to character? Why? 
4. Corece the variable you determined in *3* to a character.
