### Frequency distribution

1. Obtain the general frequency (counts) of patients for each *cancer* stage. Is this qualitative or quantitative data? 
2. What is the relative frequency (proportion) of *cancer* patients receiving treatment? 
3. What is the range of Cist number at week 3? 

### Descriptive statistics

1. Using quartiles, determine under what age are 75% of the patients.
2. What is the mean weight  of *cancer* patients at admission? And the median? 
3. What is the variance and standard deviation of *cancer* patient weight? What does this tell us?

### Plots

1. Create a boxplot for patient age. 
2. Create a histogram for patient weight.
3. Create a barplot for stage. 
4. Why do we use histogram for weight and barplot for stage?
