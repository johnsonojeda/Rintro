4. Upload the *cancer* dataframe
5. Which variables are continuous and which are discrete? 


### Central tendency and variation 

Using the *cancer* dataframe 

1. Using quartiles/percentiles, determine under what age are 75% of the patients.
2. What is the mean weight  of *cancer* patients at admission? And the median? 
3. What is the variance and standard deviation of *cancer* patient weight? What does this tell us?

### Distributions

1. Create a boxplot for patient age. 
2. Create a histogram for patient weight.
3. Create a barplot for stage. 
4. Why do we use histogram for weight and barplot for stage?
